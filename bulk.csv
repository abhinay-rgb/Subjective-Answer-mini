Biology,"Explain the process of cellular respiration.","Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), releasing waste products. It occurs in both plants and animals. The process involves glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Glycolysis breaks glucose into pyruvate, producing a small amount of ATP and NADH. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria where the Krebs cycle occurs, generating CO₂, NADH, FADH₂, and more ATP. Finally, NADH and FADH₂ donate electrons to the electron transport chain, driving ATP synthesis through oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen is essential as the final electron acceptor, forming water. This entire process yields up to 38 ATP per glucose molecule and is critical for sustaining life by providing energy for cellular functions.","ATP, glycolysis, mitochondria, Krebs cycle, electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation",31/12/2025
History,"Describe the causes and consequences of World War I.","World War I, also known as the Great War, was triggered in 1914 by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. However, its underlying causes included militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism. The complex web of alliances quickly drew multiple nations into conflict. The war saw unprecedented trench warfare and resulted in enormous casualties. Major consequences included the Treaty of Versailles, the collapse of empires (Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian, and German), economic hardship, and political instability. The League of Nations was established to prevent future wars, although it failed to stop World War II. WWI reshaped borders and societies and led to profound shifts in global power, notably weakening European dominance.","World War I, alliances, trench warfare, Versailles Treaty, nationalism",30/11/2025
Mathematics,"What is Calculus and why is it important?","Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies how things change. It includes two major areas: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus deals with the rate at which quantities change, such as velocity or slope, through the concept of the derivative. Integral calculus, on the other hand, focuses on accumulation, such as area under a curve or total distance traveled, using integrals. Calculus was independently developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. It is fundamental in fields such as physics, engineering, economics, biology, and computer science. For example, it allows physicists to model motion, engineers to design systems, and economists to analyze trends. Its ability to handle dynamic systems makes it indispensable in both theoretical and applied contexts.","calculus, derivative, integral, change, Newton, Leibniz",01/01/2026
Physics,"Explain the theory of relativity.","Einstein’s theory of relativity consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, proposed in 1905, introduced the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is constant. It led to famous equations like E=mc², indicating mass-energy equivalence. General relativity, introduced in 1915, expanded these concepts to include gravity as the warping of spacetime by mass. It predicted phenomena like black holes, time dilation, and gravitational waves. These ideas revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. They’ve been confirmed by experiments, such as light bending during eclipses and GPS requiring relativistic corrections. Relativity underpins much of modern physics.","relativity, spacetime, E=mc², gravity, time dilation, Einstein",25/12/2025
Chemistry,"Describe the periodic table and its significance.","The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, organized based on atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. Dmitri Mendeleev created the first widely recognized version, leaving gaps for undiscovered elements. The table has rows (periods) and columns (groups or families), where elements in the same group share similar properties. For instance, Group 1 elements (alkali metals) are highly reactive, while Group 18 elements (noble gases) are inert. The table helps predict the behavior of elements in reactions, understand trends like electronegativity, ionization energy, and atomic radius, and guide research in chemistry and materials science. Its organization reveals the underlying structure of atoms and is a vital tool in education and industry.","periodic table, Mendeleev, atomic number, electronegativity, groups, periods",31/12/2025
